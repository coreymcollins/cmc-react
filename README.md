# cmc-react
A first-go at a React-based WordPress theme to mimic my existing site.

Check out my main site here: https://www.coreymcollins.com/

And the React version here: https://react.coreymcollins.com/

It's not perfect and is definitely a work-in-progress, but all a part of learning process.

Thanks to [Code a React App With the WordPress REST API](https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/code-a-react-app-with-the-wordpress-rest-api) by [Jeremy McPeak](https://twitter.com/jwmcpeak) for helping to iron out some of the details I was stuck on.
